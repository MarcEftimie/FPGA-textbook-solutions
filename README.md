# FPGA_Book_Solutions
My solutions to "FPGA Prototyping By SystemVerilog Examples" by Pong P. Chu.

Each exercise's waveforms can be viewed with "make test_[exercise_name]".

I completed chapters 2-8. The rest of the book is dedicated to developing a Vanilla FPRO System which I'm not very interested in, so I won't be going through them. Part III includes hdl development of I/O cores such as SPI, I2C, PS2 etc. which I will be going through; however, I will not complete the exercises as they require development of the Vanilla FPRO System.

I hope my solutions can help you through the exercises if you get stuck. Feel free to contact me about improvements/optimizations to my code: I'm always looking to improve my skills!
