# FPGA_Book_Solutions
My solutions to "FPGA Prototyping By SystemVerilog Examples" by Pong P. Chu.

Each exercise's waveforms can be viewed with "make test_[exercise_name]".

I completed chapters 1-8. The rest of the book is dedicated to developing a Vanilla FPRO System which I'm not very interested in, so I won't be going through them. However, part III includes hdl development of I/O cores such as SPI, I2C, PS2 etc. which I will be going through.
